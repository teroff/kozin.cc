<p>My name is Stanislav. I was born physically in 1982 (please read my <a href="/testimony">salvation testimony</a>) in a country that does not exist anymore. I was born in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaganda">city</a> that became a meme in ex-USSR and a go to answer to the question, &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I was 10 years old my parents bought me my first computer a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a> a very useless piece of hardware outside of the United States and Western Europe. But I spent a lot of type behind that &ldquo;light-brown&rdquo; keyboard writing my first lines of code:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>10 PRINT &#34;HELLO WORLD&#34;
20 GO TO 10
</code></pre><p>Since then I fell in love with technology and computers in general. There was something magical about telling a computer what to do and figuring out why didn‚Äôt it do what it was supposed to do or what you thought it was supposed to do.</p>
<p>In 1994, when I was 14 years old, my family moved from Kazakhstan to Russia, and we settled in a small town on the Black Sea coast which became the capital of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games.</p>

<p>As long as I live, I always wanted to live in the United States of America. I don‚Äôt know why. I had never been to the States, didn‚Äôt speak English at all, and everything I knew about the States was from the movies. (I know) And in 2013, when I was 30 years old, God gave me this opportunity, and my dream became true. On May 31, 2013, an immigration officer said the phrase I had been waiting for, &ldquo;Welcome to the United States of America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prior moving to the States I worked as a product manager for one of the bigger cellular carrier in Russia. It was a nice and very interesting field but I always wanted to work in IT, work with computers and try that &ldquo;itching&rdquo; <em>What if</em> question on practice.</p>
<p>I became a Quality Assurance Engineer. In my carrier as a Quality Assurance Engineer I have worked for very small startups in Silicon Valley as well as for the Fortune 500 corporations testing everything from the Network to mobile applications.</p>
<p>In addition to High Tech I am fan of ice-hockey and adventure motorcycles.</p>
