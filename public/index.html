<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>
<p>My name is Stanislav Kozin. I am a Bible Believer, motorcycle adventure, Quality Assurance engineer and Linux enthusiast. I was born (physically) Kazakhstan, grew-up in Russia and currently live in the Midwest part of the USA.</p>
<h2 id="bible-believers">Bible Believers</h2>
<p>I am a Bible Believer. I was born again 

<span  title="John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. (KJV)"> <u>John 3:3</u> </span> in December of 2017. You can read my <a href="/testimony/">salvation testimony</a>. Being Bible Believers simply means that I believe in the word of God, AV1611, or commonly know as the King James Bible. I belive that God preserved His words (plural) in the King James Bible and one day He will judge everyone according to this book.</p>
