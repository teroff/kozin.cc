            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>My name is Stanislav Kozin. I am a Bible Believer, motorcycle adventure, Quality Assurance engineer and Linux enthusiast. I was born (physically) Kazakhstan, grew-up in Russia and currently live in the Midwest part of the USA. 
            </p>
            <h2>Bible Believers</h2>
            <p>
            	I am a Bible Believer. I was born again <span><u>John 3:3</u></span> in December of 2017. You can read my salvation testimony <a href="/salvation/testimony.html">here</a>. Being Bible Believers simply means that I believe in the word of God, AV1611, or commonly know as the King James Bible. I belive that God preserved His words (plural) in the King James Bible and one day He will judge everyone according to this book.
            </p>
