## Welcome
My name is Stanislav Kozin. I am a Bible Believer, motorcycle adventure, Quality Assurance engineer and Linux enthusiast. I was born (physically) Kazakhstan, grew-up in Russia and currently live in the Midwest part of the USA. 

## Bible Believers
I am a Bible Believer. I was born again {{< infored  title="John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. (KJV)" >}} <u>John 3:3</u> {{< /infored >}} in December of 2017. You can read my [salvation testimony](/testimony/). Being Bible Believers simply means that I believe in the word of God, AV1611, or commonly know as the King James Bible. I belive that God preserved His words (plural) in the King James Bible and one day He will judge everyone according to this book. 

**Are You Saved?**
Before reading any material from this website, please consider this question {{< infored class="info-red" >}}"If you die today, will you be in heaven or hell?"{{< /infored >}} And if you don't know, or not sure, please read about [Biblical salvation](/salvation/).
