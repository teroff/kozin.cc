## Introduction
The Bible says in *1Pet 3:15 "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:"*

This story is the story of my salvation, and I pray to the Lord Jesus Christ that it will lead us to the salvation of your soul.

## Orthodoxy
I was born in 1982 in ex-USSR, in a typical soviet family where God was not mentioned at all, maybe a cussword or a filler word. I never heard my parents mention God or the Lord Jesus Christ. Even though they would go to an Orthodox church once in a while: Easter, someone's wedding or funeral. For all my life I have been sure that they were practical atheists, or as I called them, "Orthodox atheists."

My grandmother, on the other hand, was a Russian Orthodox who would go to church almost every Sunday and would keep all the major feasts. When I was several months old, the decision was made to baptize me in the Russian Orthodox church.
